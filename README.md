## Project 1: RTA severity prediction**(https://github.com/smitvashisht/Road-Traffic-Accident-Severity-Prediction)**

This data set is collected from Addis Ababa Sub-city police departments for master's research work. The data set has been prepared from manual records of road traffic accidents of the year 2017-20. All the sensitive information has been excluded during data encoding and finally it has 32 features and 12316 instances of the accident. Then it is preprocessed and for identification of major causes of the accident by analyzing it using different machine learning classification algorithms. 


## Project 2: RTA severity prediction**(https://github.com/smitvashisht/Road-Traffic-Accident-Severity-Prediction](https://github.com/smitvashisht/Site-Eui-Prediction)**

This data set is collected from the lifecycle of buildings from construction to demolition was responsible for 37% of global energy-related and process-related CO2 emissions in 2020. Yet it is possible to drastically reduce the energy consumption of buildings by a combination of easy-to-implement fixes and state-of-the-art strategies.

The dataset consists of building characteristics, weather data for the location of the building, as well as the energy usage for the building, and the given year, measured as Site Energy Usage Intensity (Site EUI). Each row in the data corresponds to a single building observed in a given year.
