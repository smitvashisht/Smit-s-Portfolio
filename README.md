Repository containing projects done with ML company

## Project 1: RTA severity prediction**(https://github.com/smitvashisht/Road-Traffic-Accident-Severity-Prediction)**

This data set is collected from Addis Ababa Sub-city police departments for master's research work. The data set has been prepared from manual records of road traffic accidents of the year 2017-20. All the sensitive information has been excluded during data encoding and finally it has 32 features and 12316 instances of the accident. Then it is preprocessed and for identification of major causes of the accident by analyzing it using different machine learning classification algorithms. 


## Project 2: Site Energy Intensity Prediction**(https://github.com/smitvashisht/Site-Eui-Prediction)**

This data set is collected from the lifecycle of buildings from construction to demolition was responsible for 37% of global energy-related and process-related CO2 emissions in 2020. Yet it is possible to drastically reduce the energy consumption of buildings by a combination of easy-to-implement fixes and state-of-the-art strategies.

provided with two datasets: (1) the train_dataset where the observed values of the Site EUI for each row are provided and (2) the x_test dataset the observed values of the Site EUI for each row are removed and provided separately in y_test. Predicted the Site EUI for each row (using the complete training dataset), given the characteristics of the building and the weather data for the location of the building.
